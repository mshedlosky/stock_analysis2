# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a tool for a client that would like to understand the stock market with respect to return rates in the years 2017 and 2018. The goal is to create a user friendly tool that enables the user to quickly identify visualize stock selections that yield positive returns and negative returns.

## Results
Unfortunately, the refactored code did not run as intended. However, the code prior to the refactoring did run as expected. Thus, the following analysis is predicated on the results prior to the refactoring with the expection of the statements regarding run times. 

2018 Realized a downturn in the market compared to the high yields in 2017 with respect to the 12 tickers that were analyzed. In 2017 the only company to experience negative earnings was TERP. This is illustrated here: https://github.com/mshedlosky/stock_analysis2/blob/main/2017_Run_Time_Analysis.PNG.

Conversely, in 2018 ENPH and RUN were the only two companies that experienced positive gains, and therefore are the only two companies that reaped positive returns across both years. The following figure depicts the performance of 2018: https://github.com/mshedlosky/stock_analysis2/blob/main/2018_Run_Time_Analysis.PNG.

The code that was utilized in the intial analysis ran much slower than the refactored code. While the output did not generate the same results, and there remains to be improvement needed to accomplish this, there is a distinct difference in run times between the two methods. The refactored code ran much quicker. 

The refactored code took 0.10 seconds to run the 2017 data set compared to 1.10 seconds to run the original data set. Here are images of both run times: https://github.com/mshedlosky/stock_analysis2/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png.PNG.
